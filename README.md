Beyond the Dashboard: Communication for Impact
Besides making great dashboards, I also help clients understand the data and make smart decisions with it. By sending clear emails, I:

Shared important findings: Summarized data nicely focusing on what matters.
Tailored messages: Adjusted my language to match the client's knowledge level.
Suggested actions: Gave specific advice on what to do next.
